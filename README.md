## üåê Project Overview

This is a production-ready **URL Shortener API** designed for performance and scalability.  
It allows users to:

- Convert long URLs into short, shareable links
- Redirect users to original destinations using the short code
- Easily integrate into frontend apps, internal tools, or public services

Whether you're building a microservice architecture or a personal project,  
this API is optimized for **speed, modularity, and real-world deployment**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is built using modern and scalable technologies to ensure high performance, reliability, and maintainability:

- **üöÄ Backend Framework:** [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) ‚Äì A modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.11+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **üêò Database:** [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) ‚Äì A powerful, production-grade relational database system used for persistent URL storage.
- **üê≥ Containerization:** [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) ‚Äì For building, packaging, and running the app in isolated environments, ensuring platform consistency.
- **‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Automation:** [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) ‚Äì Automated build, test, and deployment pipeline triggered on code push to `main`.
- **‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment Target:** [AWS EC2 (Ubuntu 22.04)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) ‚Äì Cloud infrastructure hosting the application, with port `8000` publicly exposed for API access.
- **üîê Secure Access:** SSH key-based authentication ensures safe and authorized deployments to the cloud server.
- **üì¶ Package Management:** `pip` with a clean `requirements.txt` for dependency management.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Local Development

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/lyushher/fastapi-url-shortener.git

## üîÅ CI/CD Pipeline

This project follows a fully automated CI/CD process using GitHub Actions:

1. **Push to `main`**: Every code change merged into the main branch triggers the pipeline.
2. **Build & Test**: GitHub Actions builds the Docker image and runs tests to ensure stability.
3. **SSH into EC2**: Secure connection is established to the production EC2 instance.
4. **Pull Latest Code**: The latest codebase is pulled from the GitHub repository.
5. **Rebuild Docker Container**: The container is rebuilt to reflect the new changes.
6. **Restart Application**: The old container is gracefully stopped and replaced with the new version.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

Even though the service is production-ready, the current version includes the following constraints:

- ‚ùå No user authentication or API key validation  
- ‚ùå No analytics or click tracking system  
- ‚ùå No expiration or time-to-live (TTL) feature for short URLs  
- ‚ùå No support for custom domains (e.g., yourdomain.com/xyz)  
- ‚ùå No frontend interface ‚Äì this is a pure backend API
